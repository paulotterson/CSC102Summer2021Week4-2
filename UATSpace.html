<!-- Phil's Place
In a quiet farm town South of the city a cattle rancher decided he was done with the hard work and effort and wanted easy money from locals and tourists alike so that he could relax.
He decided to build a casino with free food and drinks to bring in the tourists and free cattle feed for every game played to bring in the locals. Once the casino took off Phil 
decided to travel the world and fulfill his life long dream to be a world renowned polo player. Phil travelled to Sweden and stayed in the most luxurious hotel and practice polo 
in the scenic outdoor pool. While he was away however, his cows came up with other plans. Phil's cows were filled with rage once they heard that their cattle rancer decided
he wanted the luxurious lifestyle and formed a plan to bring it down. They came into the casino one afternoon and played slots for a while while the chickens they hired went through 
the air ducts to plant the fire starters. Once the chickens completed their part of the plan, they went back to eating seeds and playing dumb. The cattle broke into the managers office
at gunpoint and robbed the safe, leaving with 2.7 million in cash. On their way out they fired a single round into the air ducts and set the casino ablaze. Phil's dreams came crashing 
down when he learned what happened and he was quickly evictetd from the luxurious Swedish hotel. He returned home determined to start another casino, but this time online, so that it 
won't be so easily sabotaged. Now Phil's place is an online platform to play Craps for small sums of money. No one knows what happened to the cows after the incident, but rumor has it 
they're pro poker players in Las Vegas's Poker ring.    d-->
